## Target Audience

Anyone between the ages of _3 and beyond_.

## Why I chose this game

-   No Age Requirement to Play
-   No need for training to compete at a professional level
-   No physical barriers to Play
-   No one is naturally better at the sport then anyone else
-   There is no setup required to start the game
-   No cleanup after the game is over
-   Allows for quick decision making
-   There is no age or gender bias

## History

The earliest form of **Rock Paper Scissors** was created in Japan and is called **Janken**. This is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. **Janken** uses the Rock, Paper and Scissors signs. It is the game that the modern version of **Rock Paper Scissors** derives from directly. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th Century. This was between the Edo and Meiji periods.

## The Game

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a zero sum game that is usually played by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome.

## Instructions

Chose one of three options to play against the computer.
Once you have chosen, the computer would also make a choice.
A win, a lose or a draw message would be posted for each party.

## Hardware Platform

This game is _web-based_ and can be played on desktop and laptop computers. _Mobile_ option for phones and tablets need optimization.

## Competition Mode

Single player

## Rules

-   Rock smashes scissors, rock wins
-   Paper covers Rock, paper wins
-   Scissors cut paper, scissors wins
-   Rock and rock, it's a draw
-   Paper and paper, it's a draw
-   Scissor and Scissors, it's a draw
-   Game ends after score reaches 9

## Strategy

Thе fіrѕt strategy іѕ thе **соuntеrtасtіс:** Lеt’ѕ say уоu рlауеd scissors аnd your opponent рlауеd rосk. Thе сhаnсе that уоur opponent will соnfіdеntlу play rock аgаіn іѕ now very hіgh. What thаt means tо уоu: аntісіраtе thаt аnd рlау paper. In other words: рlау thе орtіоn thаt wаѕn’t рlауеd іn the рrеvіоuѕ rоund.

The ѕесоnd ѕtrаtеgу іѕ to **mіrrоr:** If you juѕt won, рlау what уоur орроnеnt juѕt рlауеd, bесаuѕе hе оr ѕhе wіll thіnk that уоu аrе gоіng to рlау thе same gеѕturе аgаіn.
