# Project 1: Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a game project made in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Its a very simple game of Rock, paper scissors. I made this game as part of my first project assignment for my coding bootcamp school (General Assembly).

Here is a GIF of the game in action:

## History

The earliest form of Rock Paper Scissors was created in Japan and is called Janken. This is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. Janken uses the Rock, Paper and Scissors signs. It is the game that the modern version of Rock Paper Scissors derives from directly. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th Century. This was between the Edo and Meiji periods.

## The Game

Rock Paper Scissors is a zero sum game that is usually played by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome.

## Strategy

Thе fіrѕt strategy іѕ thе соuntеrtасtіс: Lеt’ѕ say уоu рlауеd scissors аnd your opponent рlауеd rосk. Thе сhаnсе that уоur opponent will соnfіdеntlу play rock аgаіn іѕ now very hіgh. What thаt means tо уоu: аntісіраtе thаt аnd рlау paper. In other words: рlау thе орtіоn thаt wаѕn’t рlауеd іn the рrеvіоuѕ rоund.

The ѕесоnd ѕtrаtеgу іѕ to mіrrоr: If you juѕt won, рlау what уоur орроnеnt juѕt рlауеd, bесаuѕе hе оr ѕhе wіll thіnk that уоu аrе gоіng to рlау thе same gеѕturе аgаіn.
